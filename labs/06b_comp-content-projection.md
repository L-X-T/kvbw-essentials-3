## Create your first Content Projection \*

In this exercise you create the possibility of expanding the display of the `FlightCardComponent` by transferring additional HTML to be displayed when it is called.

1. Open the file flight-search.component.html and transfer additional HTML to the*FlightCardComponent*:

   ```html
   <app-flight-card […]>
     <pre>{{ flight | json }}</pre>
   </app-flight-card>
   ```

2. Place the _ng-content_ element in the **Template** of the **FlightCardComponent** to indicate where the passed content should be displayed:

   ```html
   […]
   <div class="content">
     <p>Flight-No.: #{{ item.id }}</p>
     <p>Date: {{ item.date | date:'dd.MM.yyyy HH:mm' }}</p>

     […]

     <ng-content />
   </div>
   […]
   ```

3. Test your solution.

4. Add to the template so that it now uses the _ng-content_ element twice - once in the upper area and once in the lower area of the component:

   ```html
   […]
   <div class="content">
     <p>Flight-No.: #{{ item.id }}</p>
     <p>Date: {{ item.date | date:'dd.MM.yyyy HH:mm' }}</p>

     […]

     <ng-content select=".bottom"></ng-content>
   </div>
   […]
   ```

   In order to show Angular what has to be inserted into the individual placeholders defined with _ng-content_, they receive a CSS selector via the property _select_, which addresses part of the transferred markup. For example, the _.top_ selector searches the markup for an element with the _top_ class and inserts it into the respective _ng-content_ element.

5. Open the file _flight-search.component.html_. When calling the _flight-card_ elements, pass the two defined placeholders:

   ```html
   <app-flight-card [...]>
     <h3 class="top">Flight</h3>
     <app-flight-status-toggle class="bottom" style="margin-left: 10px" [(delayed)]="flight.delayed" />
   </app-flight-card>
   ```

6. Test your solution.
